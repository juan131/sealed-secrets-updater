## Supported Secrets Managers

Currently **only local secrets are supported**, but we plan to add support for secrets managers in the future such as Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

> Note: It is highly recommended to encrypt your local secrets using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) or similar tools.
